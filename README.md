# Fake-News-Detection

In this project, a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model has been trained to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This project could be practically used by any media company to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news related articles.
